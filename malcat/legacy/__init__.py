"""Implementations of popular CSS generators floating around MAL at the time of this writing.

These have been included for the following reasons:

- As sample code for newbie programmers from MAL demonstrating how a CSS generator might be implemented
- To make it easy to quickly re-implement or re-host a popular generator when its previous maintainer no longer
provides support for it
- Because I feel like it

Note: The only CSS generator that I (Doomcat55) personally created is MalCat (malcat-gen.appspot.com). Everything
else in this package is a result of my best attempt to replicate the functionality of other generators. So, some
of the implementations here might be different from the originals.
